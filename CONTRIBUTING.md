# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

## Steps

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
to know that you have a clean slate: `bundle && rake`

3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).

4. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

5. Make the test pass.

6. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).

7. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).

8. Create new Pull Request

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
